# Try to learn Pygame
### Just a bunch of basic scripts

This repository is just a little playground, for the first steps in Pygame

In the first way it contains only a few basic scripts, to getting feets wet.

In particular:

| name of script | it's purpose |
| :------------- | ------------: |
| 1_display_surface.py| creates a simple surface to draw on |
| 2_drawing_on_display.py| draw the first simple shapes |
| 3_blitting_images.py| putting first images on the surface |
| 4_blitting_text.py| set text in specifig font on the surface |
| 5_adding_sounds.py| adding sound with mixer |
